# Udacity Restaurant Review App
---
## Project Overview
Students were asked to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, the student takes a static design that lacks accessibility and converts the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Students also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for their users.

## Instructions
* Start a simple HTTP server to serve the site files on your computer. Python is a great option for this because it is user friendly.   * * Download and install the latest version of Python from their [website] (https://www.python.org/).
* Navigate to the project folder.
* Start the server using `-m http.server 8000`.
* Visit the site here: `http://localhost:8000`.

## Browser Compatibilities
This application has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## Acknowledgments
* Starter code was povided by Udacity.
* Matthew Cranford - dedicated student who took the time to create another tutorial with step by step instructions and screenshots. You can check out his blog [here](https://matthewcranford.com/blog/).
